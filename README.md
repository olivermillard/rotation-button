Rotation Button
================

## Main Component / Description
### RotationButton
This is a small creative coding project which takes the form of a yes/no button. Users can choose yes/no and then they are shown a flashy animation based off of their selection. Since this is meant to showcase the animation, users can click the button again after the animation is complete (as instructed by a text prompt). This triggers another animation that, when it has concluded, reverts the button back to its initial state.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
